# JS_Calculator
 
This calculator is a **click-made** one. It contains buttons of digits from `0-9` with `decimal point (.)` button. 
The four operators (`addition (+)`, `subtraction(-)`, `multiplication (*)`, and `division (/)`) buttons are also included, the `clear (C)` button whereby if click, clears out all clicked-input, also the `delete (DEL)` button which takes the job of a `backspace` and lastly the `equal sign (=)` button which operates the clicked-input with an `operator` and return the result. It also has `display box` where inputs, operation and result are shown.
